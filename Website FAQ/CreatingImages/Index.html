<h1> Three Rules for Creating Images </h1>

  <h3>
    <ol>
      <h2><li> Save Images in the Right Format </li></h2>
        <hr/>
        <p> Websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif, or png format. </br>
            If you choose the wrong image format then your image might not look as sharp as it should and can make the web page slower to load.
        </p>
      </br>

      <h2><li> Save Images at the Right Size </li></h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>You should save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website (measured in pixels).</br>
           If the image is smaller than the width or height that you have specified, the image can be distorted and stretched. </br>
           If the image is larger than the width and height you have specified, the image will take longer to display on the page.
        </p>
      <br/>
      <h2><li> Measure Images in Pixels </li></h2>
        <hr/>
        <p> Computer screens are made up of tiny squares known as pixels. </br>
            The number of pixels shown per inch of screen can vary if the user increases or decreases the resolution. </br>
            Therefore you should always measure the image in terms of the width and height in pixels (not centimeter or inch).
        </p>

  <h1> Vector Images </h1>
  <hr/>
  <h3>
    <p> Vector images are often times use for logos. </br>
        Vector images are created by placing points on a grid and drawing lines to them. </br>
        This allows vector images' size to be increased , without any quality loss!
